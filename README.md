## Project Overview
The Lost and Found web application is designed to create a centralized platform for students to report lost items and search for their belongings. The application allows users to register and login to their accounts, enabling them to post details about their lost items. Additionally, if a user finds an item, they can report it through the application. The system then help people find lost and found items, notifying the relevant individuals through mail.

## Installation

To run the Lost and Found web application locally, install XAMPP and follow these steps:

1. **Install XAMPP**: XAMPP is a cross-platform web server solution that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. You can download and install XAMPP from the official website: [https://www.apachefriends.org/](https://www.apachefriends.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silla2807/Web-Programming-Project.git
cd Web-Programming-Project
```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start XAMPP**: Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

5. **Set up the Database**:

   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` to access the phpMyAdmin interface.
   - Create a new database named "lostfound".
   - Import the SQL file provided in the repository (`lostfound.sql`) to set up the required database structure.

6. **Launch the Application**:

```bash
npm start
```

7. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost/LostFound/home.html` to access the Lost and Found web application.

Ensure that XAMPP is running and the necessary services are active while accessing the application locally.
